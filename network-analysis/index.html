One possible approach for construction of the network is to create a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph><em>bipartite</em></a> network with one partition being the members of the UK Parliament and the other partition being political topics discovered in the <a href=http://localhost:1313/DanielHolmelund/the-political-debate-in-britain-illuminated-through-quantitative-methods/text-analysis/>text analysis section</a>. Hence, we are constructing a network that tries to model the relationship between politicians and political topics based on their speeches conducted in the Parliament. Furthermore, to model the relationship within each partition, it is possible to project the initial bipartite graph into two distinct networks as depicted in the following visualization:</p><p><img src=../images/graph_construct.png width=400></p><p>Thus, we will be creating a network consisting of the members of the Parliament and a network consisting of the political topics. In the projected network with Parliament members, two members share a link/edge if they had a common political topic in the original bipartite network, also known as a common neighbour. Furthermore, the weight or strength of each edge corresponds to how many mutual neighbours the two members had in the original bipartite network. A more elaborate explanation of the technical details regarding the graph constructions can be found in the <a href=http://DanielHolmelund/the-political-debate-in-britain-illuminated-through-quantitative-methods/explainer-notebook.html>explainer notebook</a>.</p><p>The following sections will focus on network modelling, community detection, and partition comparison.</p><h4 id=network-modelling><strong>Network Modelling</strong></h4><h3 id=bipartite-network><strong>Bipartite Network</strong></h3><p><br>As previously mentioned, the first step in the network modelling was to create a bipartite network. The relations between members of the Parliament and the chosen topics were determined by assessing which topics a given member mentions sufficiently frequent in their speeches. This was accomplished by simply counting the frequency distribution of topics for each Parliament member and using the standard deviation as a threshold for determining when a topic is mentioned sufficiently frequent. Hence, for each member of the Parliament, an edge is drawn from the member to the topic, if the frequency of the topic is more than one standard deviation away from the average topic frequency for that particular Parliament member. This approach yields the following network:</p><p><img src=../images/BG.png width=600></p><p>It can be seen that there are a few nodes that are not connected to anything. These are also known as singletons. This is because of how we assign edges. If a Parliament member (PM) talks equally much about all topics, there will not be a topic of which he/she will be linked to. It is, however, possible for the PMs to have more than one edge assigned to them. These nodes can be seen as &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; between topics in the network. These bridges will thereby connect topics which actually groups similar topics together in the network. We can for example see <em>eu</em> and <em>legisl(ation)</em> are connected by multiple bridges which places them near each other in the network.
We can also see topics related to <em>health</em> by this measure include <em>test</em>, <em>pandem(ic)</em>, <em>vaccin(e)</em> and <em>educ(ation)</em>.</p><h3 id=projected-networks><strong>Projected Networks</strong></h3><p><br>Subsequently, the projected network consisting of the PMs was determined using the previously described approach to model the interaction between Parliament members. The projection yields the following PM-network:</p><p><img src=../images/proj_mp.png width=600></p><p>The annotations - or labels - of each node are determined by using the edge weights in the original bipartite network and then annotating each Parliament member with the topic associated with the highest edge weight.</p><p>We see the same trends as we saw in the bipartite network: there tend to form groups/communities which contain similar topics. However, it is more visible from this plot which communities are formed. <em>defenc(e)</em> is closely related to <em>world</em>, <em>tax</em> to <em>pension</em> and <em>legisl(ation)</em>, and <em>eu</em> to <em>legisl(ation)</em> and <em>economi(cs)</em>. The plot also tells us something about our PMs and their neighbours. The closer the distance between two PMs, the more topics of interest they share. This means that the PM-labeled version of the plot - the plot where we can see the names of the PMs - tells us which politicians are similar to each other with regards to topic mentions.</p><p>Naturally, all PMs adress all topics to some degree. Therefore, the thresholding when defining the network have a high impact on the structure of the network. However, as seen from the degree histrogram for the projected network, each node still have a very high average degree meaning that the network is associated with a high inter- or intra-connectedness.</p><p><img src=../images/degree_hist.png width=600></p><p>The average clustering coefficent for the projected graph is: 0.80. This coefficent can be seen as a probability that two random nodes in the network are linked to eachother (<a href=http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/2#clustering>source</a>). This is seen from the network visualisation that consists of many local, tightly connected clusters with <em>bridges</em> of PMs between them that connects them into a global node structure. Additionally, many links also span across the clusters, resulting in the high average clustering coefficent.</p><h4 id=community-detection><strong>Community Detection</strong></h4><p>In this section, we use the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method>Louvain algorithm</a> in order to find the best possible clusters in our network.</p><p><img src=../images/comm_size.png width=600></p><p>The size of each cluster can be seen in the barplot above. It shows us that all clusters are quite large. This means that the network is quite dense because we do not see a smaller community than we do. The network can be seen below.</p><p><img src=../images/louvain_proj_mp.png width=600></p><p>It is again apparent that the communities are pretty well inter-connected, meaning that the communities are linked together with other communities very well. This can be seen in the middle of the network, where we have a mix of different communities.</p><p>Interestingly, when comparing this plot with the previous network plot, it can be seen that some of the groups we discussed earlier have been clustered together by the Louvain algorithm. For instance, community 0 consists of, among others, <em>health</em>, <em>pandem(ic)</em>, <em>vaccin(e)</em>, and <em>test</em>.</p><h4 id=partition-comparison><strong>Partition Comparison</strong></h4><p>The following section will compare the communities detected by the Louvain algorithm with the communities created by using the edge weight between members of the Parliament and the political topics. More specifically, a topic partition will be made, by using the edge weights in the original bipartite network and then annotating each Parliament member with the topic associated with the highest edge weight, as in the first illustration of the network.</p><p>To conduct the partition comparison, we will use the <em>normalized mutual information</em> between the two partitions. Normalized mutual information can be formalized as the following:</p><p>$$I_{n}(X;Y)=\frac{I(X;Y)}{\frac{1}{2}H(X)+\frac{1}{2}H(Y)}$$</p><p>where X and Y are the partitions being compared and H(.) is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>Shanon entropy</a> e.g.:
$$H(Y)=-\sum_{x}p(y)log(p(y)))$$</p><p>Mutual information gives us an estimate of how much information one would gain regarding X if we know the variable Y. However, to be able to compare the mutual information score across different partitions which may have different sizes, the estimate has to be normalised. Furthermore, the Shanon entropy H(X) is an estimate of the information associated with the variable X.</p><p>Given that the Louvain algorithm is stochastic to a certain degree, the detected communities may differ based on initialization. Hence, to calculate the normalised mutual information between the Louvain partition and the topic partition with an uncertainty measure, the Louvain algorithm was executed a thousand times while determining the normalised mutual information (NMI) in each repetition. The average NMI between the two partitions with a 95% confidence interval was:
$$mean(I(Louvain\ partition,\ Topics\ partition)) = 0.30 \pm 0.001$$</p><p>To assess whether or not the estimated normalised mutual information is significant, a randomisation test was conducted. The randomisation was done by randomly shuffling the topic partition, and then computing the normalised mutual information between the Louvain communities and the random partition. To achieve a measure of uncertainty, the described procedure was repeated a thousand times, which yielded the following illustration:</p><p><img src=../images/NMIs.png width=600></p><p>Thus, the partition comparison yielded that there was some shared information between the topic partition and the detected communities of the Louvain algorithm, and that the estimated normalised mutual information was statistically significant from zero. However, it also becomes evident that not all the information of one partition can be described using the other partition. Hence, an interesting question to ask could be: what community structure describes the true nature of the network best?</p><p><br></p><p>To address this question, the modularity Q can be used. Modularity is a measure of how well a partition separates the network into communities. The estimated modularity of the two partitions was:</p><p>$$Q_{Louvain} \approx 0.27$$
$$Q_{Topic} \approx 0.16$$</p><p>Therefore, the estimated modularities mean that the Louvain algorithm&rsquo;s partition is associated with a higher modularity, which entails that the detected community structure by the Louvain algorithm is more appropriate to the true nature of the network structure than the topic partition.</p><p>Consequently, an investigation of the topics within the detected Louvain communities could be interesting to elucidate if any interesting patterns and similarities emerge among the community members. One approach would simply be to compute the normalised topic frequency distribution within each community:</p><p><img src=../images/comm_hist_0.png width=800></p><p>As mentioned before, community 0 consists of <em>health</em>-related topics such as <em>vaccin(e)</em>, <em>test</em> and <em>pandem(ic)</em>.</p><p><img src=../images/comm_hist_1.png width=800></p><p>Subsequently, the frequency distribution of community 1 is mainly dominated by the topic <em>legislation</em> followed by <em>EU</em> which probably corresponds to the large mixed cluster in the previous network plot.</p><p><img src=../images/comm_hist_2.png width=800></p><p>The topic frequencies within community 2 are more various, with the most frequent topics being <em>world</em>, <em>education</em>, <em>tax</em>, <em>economy</em>, <em>defence</em> and <em>employment</em>.</p><p><img src=../images/comm_hist_3.png width=800></p><p>And finally, the topic distribution of community 3 demonstrates that the members of the community are mainly associated with the topic <em>EU</em>.</p><p>Following this, the TF-IDF-weights can be used to generate WordClouds related to each detected community as previously done in the <a href=http://localhost:1313/DanielHolmelund/the-political-debate-in-britain-illuminated-through-quantitative-methods/text-analysis/>text analysis section</a>. One feasible approach for computing the TF-IDF is to group the speeches of the Parliament members, who are within the same community as a single document. Thereby, resulting in four documents; one for each community. First the TF is computed by counting terms in the document, while the IDF is computed on the entire corpus to achieve reasonable estimates. Subsequently, the TF-IDF representations of the four documents are computed by dividing the two. The described approach yields the following WordClouds for each community:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Community 0</th><th style=text-align:center>Community 1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/wordcloud_0.png width=600></td><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/wordcloud_1.png width=600></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we see words like <em>health</em>, <em>care</em>, <em>servic(e)</em> and <em>state</em> in the WordCloud for community 0 which sound like they fit the overall <em>health care</em> theme. Community 1 consists of words like <em>legisl(ation)</em>, <em>eu</em> and <em>law</em> which also seems to fit the <em>legislation / eu</em> theme.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Community 2</th><th style=text-align:center>Community 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/wordcloud_2.png width=600></td><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/wordcloud_3.png width=600></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Community 2 is the mixed community, and that shows in its WordCloud. Words like <em>import</em>, <em>countri(es)</em>, and <em>local</em> seem to fit topics like <em>economi(cs)</em>, <em>world</em>, and <em>educ(ation)</em>. Finally, we see community 3 which mostly contains the topic, <em>eu</em>. It contains words like <em>eu</em>, <em>trade</em>, <em>vote</em> and <em>import</em>.</p><p>The findings of this analysis demonstrate that using methods from the network science field it is possible to discover communities of members within the British Parliament. Furthermore, when combining the network science methods with simple text analysis tools, it becomes feasible to try and understand the communities in terms of which words are important for each community. The political finding that a member of the Parliament tends to address topics which are similar e.g. <em>EU</em> and <em>legislation</em>, may be unsurprising. However, being able quantitatively to verify or falsify our assumptions of the workings and nature of politics may still prove to be useful.</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left><p><a href=../data-description class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">&lt;
