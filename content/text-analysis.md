**Characterizing Words of the Speeches From Each Party**
<br />
The following section will attempt to discover words that characterize each of the political parties in the British Parliament using the transcripts described in the Data section (Insert ref to data). More specifically, the weighting scheme TF-IDF will be used to find words/terms that describe the speeches conducted by each party. In the following analysis, only a subset of the parties has been chosen namely the Liberal Democrat, Conservative, Labour, Scottish National Party, UK Independence Party and the Green Party (WordClouds for all parliaments can be found here). The WordClouds are depicted as follows:

The WordClouds embeds a rich amount of information in a relatively dense illustration. Hence, it may be tedious to find descriptive words at first sight. However, diving deeper into the particular WordClouds does reveal insightful information regarding the parties.
