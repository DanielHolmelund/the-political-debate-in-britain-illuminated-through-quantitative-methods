# **Why Should You Read This Website?**

One of the perks about democratic society is the idea that the people can hold their elected officials accountable. This, however, can get pretty problematic when each politician have their own opinions on most topics; who says what, and why?

This project will focus on quantatively analysing the discourse and debate in British parliament. We will investigate frequently discussed topics in political parties, the similarity between these parties, and the interactions between political actors. The former will be done through natural language processing - or text analysis - and the latter through network analysis.

**Disclaimer:** In the plot above, the values on the bars have no meaning in relation. The x-axis describes the normalised frequency of topics.

To fulfill this analysis the following research questions will be adressed:

* What insights can be obtained from using traditional text-mining methods such as TF-IDF?
* How can the political activity in the British Parliament be modelled as a network?
* What insights can be obtained from using a network science approach?
* How can text-mining and network science approaches be combined to provide a holistic understanding of potential political communities and the topics discussed within a community?

In the following sections there will be a high-level presentation of the insights gained from applying different analytical methods to the data obtained from the two Parliament houses in the United Kingdom. For a more in-depth and under the hood explanation of the project we refer you to our [Explainer Notebook](Explainer_notebook.html).
