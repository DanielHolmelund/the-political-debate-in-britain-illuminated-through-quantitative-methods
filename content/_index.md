One of the perks about democratic society is the idea that the people can hold their elected officials accountable. This, however, can get pretty problematic when each politician have their own opinions on most topics; who says what, and why?

This project will focus on quantatively analysing the discourse and debate in British parliament. We will investigate frequently discussed topics in political parties, the similarity between these parties, and the interactions between political actors. The former will be done through natural language processing - or text analysis - and the latter through network analysis.

(Disclaimer: In the above plot the values out from the bars have no meaning in relation. The x-axis describes the normalized frequency of topics)

The following sections will be a high-level presentation of the insights gained when applying different analytic methods to the data obtained from the two Parliament houses in the UK. For a more in-depth and under the hood explanation of the project please refer to our [Explainer Notebook](explainer-notebook.html).
