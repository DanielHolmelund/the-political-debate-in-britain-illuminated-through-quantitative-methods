The political system itself is built upon a very complicated system with a lot of different actors that all have their own agendas. A place where key figures of this system clash, discuss their idea and try to enforce their ideology and political beliefs is the Parliament. Therefore this project will try to explore these complex networks of interactions. This will mainly be done through a toolbox consisting of text analysis of the PM's statements in the British Parliament and network analysis.

The following sections will be a high-level presentation of the insights gained when applying different analytic methods to the data obtained from the two Parliament houses in the UK. For a more in-depth and under the hood explanation of the project please refer to our [Explainer Notebook](explainer-notebook.html).
